This code is used to add metadata to mp3 files (such as song name, album, who sings it) based on the filename they have, this may work for downloads via youtube that dont have the metadata on in.                  
There is a small chance that the program will make a mistake, since there are several songs with the same name.                    
you have to install mutagen and musicbrainzngs via python with this command:              
pip command install mutagen musicbrainzngs                                                
then you have to edit the code, in such a way that in the spaces where indicated you put the data of the musicbrainzngs account and the location of the folder where you have the mp3 files.                                           
After running the file, it will do everything by itself.                                                      
(I will try to simplify it, such as converting it into .exe and making it a graphical interface)
